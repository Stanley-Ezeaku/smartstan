Face Recognition and Authentication App with TensorFlow Lite.

## Getting Started

Simple Face Recognition authentication (Sign up + Sign in). It works with two device vision models working together, the google ML kit vision model and MobileFaceNet model.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
